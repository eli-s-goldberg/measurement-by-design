# Measurement by design

Of the subset of things that providers, payers, and people _should_ do to help their members and patients and selves, one can only afford to do a smaller subset... _always_. In order to make this bet, you need to understand how to go from an idea to an intervention design to a business case estimate of the incremental clinical and financial impact to marketing material that will drive behavior change to understanding the degree to which that intervention _credibly_ moves the needle on cost and health. 


## Purpose
The purpose of this demo is to clearly articulate and provide an example of how to create, size, sell, optimize, and understand the impact of an intervention on your book.
